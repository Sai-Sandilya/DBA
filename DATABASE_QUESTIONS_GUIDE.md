## üí° Tips for Better Questions

1. **Be Specific:** Instead of "Show me data", try "Show me recent orders from the last 7 days"

2. **Use Database-Specific Terms:**
   - MySQL/PostgreSQL: "tables", "records", "indexes"
   - MongoDB: "collections", "documents", "aggregations"
   - Redis: "keys", "values", "memory usage"
   - Elasticsearch: "indices", "documents", "queries"

3. **Ask for Analysis:** 
   - "Analyze the performance of..."
   - "Check for issues in..."
   - "Optimize the query..."

4. **Request Specific Information:**
   - "Show me the top 10 slowest queries"
   - "Find all tables larger than 1GB"
   - "Check for unused indexes"

## üîß Adding New Database Types

To add support for a new database type:

1. **Update the configuration** in `config/config.yaml`
2. **Add database-specific questions** in `core/web/interface.py`
3. **Implement database connector** in `core/database/connector.py`
4. **Add query analysis logic** in the appropriate assistant modules

## üìä Database Status Indicators

- üü¢ **Connected** - Database is configured and accessible
- üî¥ **Not Configured** - Database is not set up
- üìö **Knowledge Base** - Educational content mode
- ‚ö™ **No Selection** - No database selected
